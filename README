This program has been simmering in my mind since 1993.  It finally got written
in 2011 and is a gift to the community.

****************** CURRENTLY BROKEN (DO NOT USE!) ************************

Command Line Options:

	-v switch shows the version.
	-h shows the help.
	-p Number of times to encode the file. You will be prompted to enter a
	   different key on each pass.
	-r removes the input file
	-i input file
	-o output file

To Encrypt a File:
	sc -p1 -i plaintext.txt -o cyphertext.txt

	This will encrypt the plaintext.txt file and write the encoded
	cyphertext.txt file.  This is a single pass (-p1) and will only ask
	for one key to encrypt the file.

To Decrypt a File:
	sc -p1 -i cyphertext.txt -o plaintext.txt

	In order to get the original plaintext.txt file back you need to use
	the cyphertext file as the input and the plaintext as the out put.
	Use the same number of passes and the same keys in the same order as
	you did when encrypting the plaintext.txt.

WARNING:
	(Do not encrypt yourself :^)
	At this time Simple Crypt reads the entire file that is being encrypted
	into memory.  It has been tested with a 1G file on a computer with 4G
	RAM and it worked fine but was slow.  Be sure that you have enough RAM
	to encode a file.

	UPDATE : As of May 18 2012:

		Simple-Crypt now uses mmap() for file I/O.  Has been tested with
	5G and 60G files on system with 4G RAM and 8G swap.  Runs slow as a file
	copy is needed.

NOTE:
	Simple Crypt works on both binary and text files.  Open Solaris 11 should
	work fine now.  Builds on Windows with cygwin tool chain though it needs
	testing. Cygwin can be downloaded at http://www.cygwin.com/  Ran through
	Valgrind and removed all but one memory leak.

	Also, builds on Haiku-OS (shredder 1 42211) and Open Indiana ver. 151a4
	x86pc 64Bit.

To Build:

	You will need a C compiler.  I recommend GCC.  On Linux or Unix you
	should have a C compiler installed by default.  If not check your
	distributions documentation on how to install it.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

How to build:

$ make
Be sure that you have a ~/bin and it is in your $PATH
$ make install

That's it.  Have Fun!!
